## Pretty awesome backend using Scala 3 and ZIO

### Naming Things
Yeah we know that there are two hard thing in software development, cache invalidation and naming things!
Because of this, we will name the things simple here.
For CRUD operations:
  - Create 
  - Get
  - Update
  - Remove
So basically we have a CGUR here hahahah. :P

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
